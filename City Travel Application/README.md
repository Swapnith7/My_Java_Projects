# City Travel Application

This Java project is a City Travel Application that helps users find the shortest path and minimum cost between two cities. The application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the minimum cost path between cities and displays the result to the user.

## Features

1. **List all locations:** Allows users to view a list of all available locations (nodes/places) in the network.

2. **Get shortest path:** Enables users to find the shortest path and minimum cost between a source city and a destination city.

3. **Exit:** Exits the application.

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the `Main.java` file.

2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - Option 1: List all locations.
   - Option 2: Get the shortest path from a source station to a destination station.
   - Option 3: Exit the application.

3. If choosing option 2:
   - Enter the source city (e.g., "New York City, NY").
   - Enter the destination city (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA").
   - The application will calculate and display the minimum cost path and the minimum cost.

4. Continue exploring the application until you choose to exit.

## Data

The application uses a sample dataset of cities and their connections. Each connection has an associated cost (weight).

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Git installed
